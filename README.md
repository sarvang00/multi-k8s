# multi-k8s

### Description
In this project, we have used the fibbo calculator project as base and are now transitioning it from a Docker project to Kubernetes Deployment demo project.

The Docker-ised version of this project is: https://github.com/sarvang00/multi-docker


## Archive Note
I had made this project to learn DevOps and Automation related concepts. This repo seems to have achieved its purpose and is now archived. Will re-activate it or make a new repo if I would want to learn more.
